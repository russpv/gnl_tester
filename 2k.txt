Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer With a teenage diplomat In the dumps with the mumps As the adolescent pumps his way into his hat With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older I tripped the merry-go-round With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing The calliope crashed to the ground Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot Snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot With a whatnot in her hand And now young Scott with a slingshot Finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers Daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night Blinded by the light She got down but she never got tight But she'll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone Rolling stone preacher from the East He says, dethrone the dictaphone Hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone Watchin' the young girls dance And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone To remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night Blinded by the light He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager's mister Told me I got what it takes She said, I'll turn you on, sonny To something strong if you'll play that song with the funky break And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart To see if it was safe to go outside And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly And asked me if I needed a ride Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer Playin' backyard bombardier Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard They sent some dude with a calling card He said, do what you like, but don't do it here Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the 
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden and she lives for me, says she lives for me, Ovation, what a motivation, she comes round and she goes down on me, And I make her smile, like a drug for you, Do ever what you want to do, Coming over you, Keep on smiling, what we go through. One stop to the rhythm that divides you, And I speak to you like the to the verse, Chop another line like a coda with a curse, come on like a freak show takes the stage. We give them the games we play, she say, I want something else, to get me through this, Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby, I want something else, I'm not listening when you say, Good-bye. The sky it was gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it through my nose, And I wish I could get back there, Some place back there, Smiling in the pictures you would take, Doing crystal myth, Will lift you up until you break, It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock, With a tick tock rhythm a bump for the drop, And then I bumped up. I took the hit I was given, And I bumped again, And I bumped again. How do I get back there to, The place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to, The place where you said, I want something else to get me through this, semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby, I want something else, I'm not listening when you say, good-bye, I believe in the sand beneath my toes, The beach gives a feeling, An earthy feeling, I believe in the faith that grows, And the four right chords can make me cry, When I'm with you I feel like I could die. And that would be all right, All right, When the plane came in, She said she was crashing, The velvet it rips, In the city we tripped, On the urge to feel alive, But now I'm struggling to survive, Those days you were wearing, That velvet dress, You're the priestess, I must confess, Those little red panties, They pass the test, Slide up around the belly, Face down on the mattress, One, And you hold me, And we're broken. Still it's all tha
